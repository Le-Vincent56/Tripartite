# Tripartite
Tripartite is an interactive fiction work that revolves around Dane, an amnesiac trapped in a blind world, and three voices, Egor, Ida, and Summer. As an attempt to understand context-aware dialogue systems, Tripartite follows a branching narrative as the user makes choices that influence the story and the dialogue that is said during it.
