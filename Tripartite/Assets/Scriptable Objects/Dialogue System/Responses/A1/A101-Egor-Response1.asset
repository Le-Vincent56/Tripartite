  - "... due to the displacement of the children from their parents, Reeves killed
    the parents first before finding the children in a nearby shed. The bodies were
    found a couple days later. Malcolm Cullen, the brother of victim and mother Rosa
    Cullen, states that he \u201Cwas awaiting further information\u201D for a party
    that he and his sister were planning for their mother\u2019s birthday. With the
    lack of response, Malcolm figured something was wrong and visited the ghostly
    home."
