  - "Due to the displacement of the children from their parents, Reeves killed the
    parents first before finding the children in a nearby shed. The bodies were found
    a couple days later. Malcolm Cullen, the brother of victim and mother Rosa Cullen,
    states that he \u201Cwas awaiting further information\u201D for a party that
    he and his sister were planning for their mother\u2019s birthday. With the lack
    of response, Malcolm figured something was wrong and visited the ghostly home."
